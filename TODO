Order that I want to try these languages out in:

-1- Java //-1 because I don't really feel as though finishing anyprojects in
         // java is absolutely necessary.
0 - JS
1 - Dart //JS before Dart, Dart seems like an improvement over JS
2 - Haskell //should definitely learn a proper (or the popular) functional lang
3 - Python //people like it
4 - Scala //functional, OO, awkward?
5 - Clojure // a Lisp
6 - Rust //it's new
7 - Go //its new
