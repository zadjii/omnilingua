# mapgen

A map generator that I wrote to help familiarize myself with Javascript.

Currently uses 3 different generation algorithms to create a simple landmass.

I kinda just stopped working on it because I'd rather learn more about other languages than JS.

##TODO
- add continient generator by polygon subdividing.
- add dropping within polygon generator
- add dropping along a brownian path 
- add climate and features generaion

## Usage

open your favorite browser and point it at maps.html
